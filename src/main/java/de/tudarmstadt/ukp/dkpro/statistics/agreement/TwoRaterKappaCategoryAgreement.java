/**
 * Modified version of Cohen's kappa for measuring a chance-corrected
 * inter-rater agreement for a certain category. A prerequisite of this 
 * measure is an annotation study that involves at least three categories. 
 * For studies with only two categories, the measure is equivalent to 
 * the general kappa. This implementation is intended for studies with two 
 * raters, see {@see MultiRaterPiCategoryAgreement} for an implementation 
 * involving multiple raters.
