/**
 * Basic interface representing the essential data model of any annotation study. The data model
 * provides access to the raters participating in the annotation study, the set of categories a
 * rater may use, and the annotation units. Each unit represents a single annotation (i.e., the
 * decision of a single rater to assign one of the categories to a predefined or rater-defined
 * unit). The interface acts as the common ground for any inter-rater agreement measure, whereas its
 * two fundamental extensions - the coding and the unitizing study interfaces - provide further
 * interface methods necessary for calculating individual measures.
