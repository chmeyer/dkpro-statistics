 * Interface for a distance function to be used in any {@link IWeightedAgreement} measure, such as

 * distance function for quantifying the degree of disagreement between a pair of categories (i.e.,
 * two annotations assigned to a certain item by different raters). If annotation units are, for
 * instance, coded using integers, the distance function might assign a smaller distance to the
 * category pair (1, 2) then to the category pair (2, 9). See implementations of this interface for
 * more detailed examples.
