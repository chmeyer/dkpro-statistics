/**
 * Implementation of the {@link IDistanceFunction} interface for scoring the 
 * distance between interval-scaled categories. That is to say, categories 
 * represent a numerical value whose difference can be measured. A typical
 * example is date as measures, for instance, using the Gregorian calendar.
 * We are able to measure the difference between the years 2010 and 2000
 * and to say that the difference equals the difference between he years
 * 1980 and 1970. However, we cannot say that 2000 is twice the year 1000,
 * since there is no absolute zero (note that the year 0 is arbitrarily 
 * defined and that we need to cater for years such as 200 BCE). For
 * natural language processing tasks, judging the similarity between two 
 * entities on a linear scale of, say, 1 to 6 is another example for 
 * interval-scaled data. Mathematically, the interval scale only allows for 
 * the equality, comparison, and addition operations, but prohibits 
 * multiplication. The distance function returns the squared difference 
 * between the numerical representation of two categories. It thus assumes 
 * the categories to be integers or doubles and falls back to a 
 * {@link NominalDistanceFunction} for other data types.<br><br>
